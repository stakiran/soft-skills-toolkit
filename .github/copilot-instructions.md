I expected GitHub.com Copilot to read this, but since it doesn’t work, I’m stopping (as of 2025-12-21).

Details:

- Expected:
    - Go to https://github.com/stakiran/soft-skills-toolkit and open Copilot from the Copilot button in the top right.
    - Ask for help with a problem.
    - Then, it would suggest templates from within sstk.
- Actual:
    - It doesn’t load the contents of the files in sstk (it says it doesn’t have sufficient permissions).
