# Soft Skills Toolkit (sstk)

## Current Status: Under Construction
- Expanding the toolkit
- Tasks:
    - 👉️Expand the tools (at least 10+)
    - 👉️Create a list of tools -> [index](index.md)
    - ...

---

## What is this?
Welcome. I'm building "soft-skill engineering" and cover its theories and concepts on [sta - DEV Community](https://dev.to/stakiran). This repository is where I publish **tools** that help you put soft skills into practice.

## For Users: How to Use

### 👉️[Start here](index.md)

### Notes
- "Tools" here do not mean software. They refer to things like templates, checklists, and procedures.
- Written in Markdown, so you can use them immediately via copy-and-paste.
    - Of course, you can also integrate them with AI agents.
- Supported languages:
    - Japanese
    - English (files with `_EN` at the end of the filename)

## For Developers: Development
About the tools:

- Creating tools
    - Write them in Markdown. The template is `_new.md`.
- Translating tools
    - The original is in Japanese.
    - Use `translator.py` to translate into English. You can quickly run it as a task in VSCode.
    - Translation uses the OpenAI API.
- Deploying tools
    - For now, the assumption is that people will view the repository directly on GitHub.
    - I'd also like to consider a static site. GitHub Pages should be sufficient.

About repository operations:

- The branch is master only.
    - Because sstk is "always unfinished."
    - If the latest state has issues, just roll back as needed.
- Issues are welcome.
- Pull Requests are not accepted.
    - Because this sstk is my work.
    - I'd like to create a separate repository later for "sstk built together by everyone."
        - Something like awesome-sstk?
