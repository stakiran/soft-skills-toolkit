## What's this?
Welcome. I'm building "Soft Skills Engineering," and I cover the theory and concepts on [sta - DEV Community](https://dev.to/stakiran). This is the place where I publish **tools** that help you apply soft skills effectively.

## How to use
- "Tools" here don't mean software; they refer to things like templates, checklists, and procedures
- Everything is written in Markdown, so readers can use it immediately by copy/paste
    - Of course, you can also integrate it with AI agents
- Supported languages are as follows:
    - Japanese
    - English (filenames end with `_EN`)

## Development
- Creating tools
    - Write them in Markdown. The template is `_new.md`
- Translating tools
    - The original is in Japanese
    - For English translation, use `translator.py`. You can invoke it right away as a task in VSCode
    - Translation uses the OpenAI API
- Deploying tools
    - For now, the assumption is that people will view them directly on GitHub
    - I'd also like to consider a static site. GitHub Pages should be sufficient
