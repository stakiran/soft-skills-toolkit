# Casual Agile
- A structured take on agile as a soft skill
- A set of simple concepts and practices that you can freely mix and match

A question list used when designing the 3R cycle:

```markdown
Note: 3R means Rough Plan → Run → Retrospective

- Q1: How long will you work in an agile way?
    - (Specify an actual time period)
- Q2: How long is one sprint?
    - (In days or weeks)
- Q3: What is the format for the Rough Plan, and what is the maximum character count?
- Q4: How will you handle async communication during Run?
- Q5: If you really feel the need to meet during Run, what will you do?
- Q6: How will you run the Retrospective, and what questions will you ask?
```

A trigger list to ask yourself when you feel documentation/material creation is taking too long:

```markdown
- Would a Mechanical Style (showing the output from an AI conversation as-is) be acceptable?
- Why is it not acceptable?
- Would a Rough Style (writing roughly in plain text, or in a note/wiki page) be acceptable?
- Why is it not acceptable?
- Are you creating materials in a Formal Style (slides or rich-text documents)?
- Why must it be Formal Style?
```

A trigger list to ask whether you can apply effectuation:

```markdown
- The Bird in Hand:
    - 1: List as many resources you currently have as possible
    - 2: Consider whether you can create something by combining what you listed
- The Affordable Loss:
    - 3: What level of loss is acceptable?
    - 4: Can you provide those resources all at once?
    - 5: If you cannot, why can't you? What would make it possible?
- Crazy-Quilt: 
    - 6: List as many stakeholders as possible that you can reach
    - 7: For each stakeholder you listed, decide whether to make some adjustment/arrangement with them, or skip because you can't
    - 8: If you have too few stakeholders, or nothing progresses even after making decisions, discuss how you could break through the situation
- Lemonade:
    - 9: Did something unexpected happen? What was it?
    - 10: Can you treat it as an opportunity to negotiate or pivot?
- Pilot-in-the-Plane:
    - 11: List what is currently bothering you
    - 12: Split them into "things you can control" and "things you can't control"
    - 13: Are you worrying because you're focusing on "things you can't control"? If so, can you stop?
```

A checklist for self-reflection when delegation isn't working well:

```
- 1: I am not micromanaging (requesting status reports and/or meetings more than once a day)
    - y | n
- 2: I am an advisor: I give advice but do not make decisions. I leave decision-making to the delegate
    - y | n
- 3: The delegate sees me as an advisor and can make their own decisions without being constrained by me
    - y | n
- 4: The delegate has the capability to make decisions on their own
    - y | n
- 5: I have a genuine reason or necessity for delegating this authority
    - y | n
- 6: Even if the delegate fails, I am willing to take responsibility
    - y | n

This is the advice process from Teal organizations.
If you want to delegate well, aim to be able to answer "Yes" to all of them.
