# Casual Innovation
- Increase the probability of encountering innovation, and especially believe that you *can* increase it
- This toolkit organizes principles and ways of thinking to make that happen
- Tendencies of this toolkit
    - Focus on individuals going deep, concentrating hard, and producing 0-to-1 outcomes
    - On the other hand, it sometimes covers tools that rely on tight collaboration in a small group (tagged with 🧑‍🤝‍🧑)

# Tools
The three S's you want to have in your daily life:

```markdown
- Slack
    - 1: Do you have at least 3 hours of time slack per day?
    - 2: Beyond time slack, do you also have "cognitive slack" that allows for 2+ hours of divergent work?
    - 3: Can you secure 1+2 for several months?
- Solo
    - 4: During your Slack time, can you reduce interference from all living beings to zero?
    - 5: During your Slack time, can you reduce distraction from other tasks or entertainment to zero?
    - 6: Do you have a mechanism for breaks and rest?
- Stress
    - 7: Can you work on the theme sustainably for several months without harming your physical or mental health?
    - 8: Can you work on the theme sustainably for several months without damaging your motivation?
    - 9: Can you work on the theme sustainably for several months without harming your career or your near-term livelihood?
```

The four S's you should apply to your environment:

```markdown
- Speedy
    - Being "fast" in every aspect: specs, responsiveness, procedures, etc.
    - Like athletes or pro gamers, pursue speed even at the 0.x-second level, and be able to keep getting closer to it
- Seamless
    - Being able to move in a rhythm that feels natural to you; being "smooth"
    - This includes not only daily thinking and work, but also switching between work and life
- Silent
    - Being quiet
    - At minimum, keeping noise in the 40 dB range or lower
- Solitary
    - Being alone
    - Being able to drive interruptions and temptations close to zero, from people and pets to all kinds of notifications
```

🧑‍🤝‍🧑A question list to avoid killing members from whom you want innovative work:

```markdown
- Q1: Do you really need a project?
    - Could you use a Transject instead?
- Q2: Do you really need waterfall or agile?
    - Could you use Exploratory instead?
- Q3: Is the team small?
    - Are you following the Minimum Main Member Principle?
- Q4: Are you monitoring experiencity rather than managing productivity?
    - If you are managing productivity, can you throw all of it away?
```

# Reference: Transject
👉️ [Project vs Transject - DEV Community](https://dev.to/stakiran/project-vs-transject-cpd)

A Transject is:

- A way of working where you do not belong to any project at all
- Key characteristics:
    - Self-directed, with no connection to management or planning
    - Continuously broadcasts information to a broad audience
    - Does not directly lead to revenue, but can still create influence

How to think about using Transject as Casual Innovation:

- Transject members consistently satisfy the 3S's
- However, since an individual alone is prone to bias, they solicit feedback by broadcasting information broadly

# Reference: Exploratory
~~👉️ (No article)~~

Exploratory is:

- A third stream following waterfall and agile
- You define only an "exploration period," and during that time anything is allowed
- Done with a small group of 4 people or fewer
- You must prepare the following
    - A theme: one line describing what you will explore
    - A shared workspace: a workspace where you share what you thought and what you built day to day
- You do none of the following
    - Meetings or conversations
    - Directions or orders
    - Plans
- You actively do the following
    - Put as much information as possible into the shared workspace; proactively include the process, not just the results
    - Read what's in the shared workspace and use it for reference or inspiration
    - Freely reuse what's in the shared workspace
        - No consideration or respect required. Use it like a toy. Use it however you like.
