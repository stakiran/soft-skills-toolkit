# Casual Innovation
- Increase the probability of encountering innovation, especially by believing that you *can* increase that probability
- This toolkit organizes principles and ways of thinking to do so
- Tendencies of this toolkit
    - Focuses on individuals going deep, concentrating hard, and producing 0-to-1 outcomes
    - On the other hand, it sometimes covers tools for tight collaboration in small groups (marked with 🧑‍🤝‍🧑)

# Tools
The three S's you want to have in place in everyday life:

```markdown
- Slack
    - 1: Do you have at least 3 hours of time slack per day?
    - 2: Beyond just time slack, do you also have "cognitive slack" that allows for 2+ hours of divergent work?
    - 3: Can you secure 1+2 for multiple months?
- Solo
    - 4: During Slack, can you reduce interference from any living being to zero?
    - 5: During Slack, can you reduce distractions from other tasks or entertainment to zero?
    - 6: Do you have a mechanism for breaks and rest?
- Stress
    - 7: Can you work on the theme continuously for multiple months without harming your mental or physical health?
    - 8: Can you work on the theme continuously for multiple months without damaging your motivation?
    - 9: Can you work on the theme continuously for multiple months without harming your career or your near-term life?
```

The four S's you should apply to your environment:

```markdown
- Speedy
    - "Fast" in every respect: specs, responsiveness, procedures, etc.
    - Like athletes or pro gamers, you pursue speed even down to 0.x seconds, and can keep getting closer to that
- Seamless
    - Being able to move in a rhythm that feels natural to you. Being "smooth"
    - Includes not only daily thinking and work, but also switching between work and life
- Silent
    - Being quiet
    - At minimum, quietness in the 40 dB range or lower
- Solitary
    - Being solitary
    - Being able to reduce interruptions and temptations to near zero, from people and pets to notifications of all kinds
```

🧑‍🤝‍🧑A question list to avoid killing members from whom you want innovative work:

```markdown
- Q1: Is the project really necessary?
    - Can't you use a transject instead?
- Q2: Do you really need waterfall or agile?
    - Can't you use Exploratory instead?
- Q3: Is the team small?
    - Are you following the Minimum Main Member Principle?
- Q4: Are you monitoring experiencity rather than managing productivity?
    - If you are managing productivity, can't you throw all of it away?
```

# Reference: Transject
👉️ [Project vs Transject - DEV Community](https://dev.to/stakiran/project-vs-transject-cpd)

A transject (Transject) is:

- A way of being where you do not belong to any project at all
- Key characteristics:
    - Independent of management and planning, operating autonomously
    - Continuously broadcasting information to a broad audience
    - Not directly tied to revenue, but still able to create influence

How to think about using a transject as casual innovation:

- Transject members consistently satisfy the 3S's
- However, because the person alone is susceptible to bias, they broadcast information broadly and accept feedback

# Reference: Exploratory
~~👉️ (No article)~~

Exploratory is:

- The third major stream following waterfall and agile
- You define only an "exploration period," and during that time anything is allowed
- Done with a small group of 4 or fewer
- You must prepare the following:
    - A theme: one line on what you will explore
    - A shared workspace: a workspace to share what you thought and what you made day to day
- You do none of the following:
    - Meetings or conversations
    - Instructions or commands
    - Planning
- You proactively do the following:
    - Put as much information as possible into the shared workspace, actively including the process, not just the results
    - Read the shared workspace content and use it for reference and inspiration
    - Freely use the shared workspace content
        - No restraint or respect required. Use it like a toy. Use it however you like.
