# List Kit
- A framework for managing lists
- Provides hints for deciding how to manage them
- "Management" includes designing, creating, operating, and distributing

# Tools
3L cycle:

```markdown
## List (title here)
- (list items)
- ...

## Log
- (impressions after trying it, progress, and results)
- ...

## Lesson
- (reflection based on the log and what you learned from it)
- ...
```

3L cycle discussion points:

```
- Do you write the 3Ls in the same file, or split them into separate files?
- How do you write timestamps for Log and Lesson? How do you separate entries?
- When do you write Log and Lesson?
- What format do you use for Log and Lesson entries?
```

Trigger list for designing when to use a list:

```markdown
- Is it As an input?
    - Example: I'll read this as input before doing ~~
- Is it As a tool?
    - Example: I can use this to do ~~ so I'll use it
- Is it As an output?
    - Example: I want to capture ~~ now, so I'll capture it in list form
...
```

Trigger list for designing how to use a list:

```
- Order: Do you read it top to bottom in sequence?
- Write-in: Do you write answers into it?
- Immediacy: Does it drive action on the spot? (Does not include thinking or writing; a typical example is a procedure.)
- Optionality: Is it okay to skip an item?
```

Trigger list for designing how to start using a list:

```
- When and how will you remember that the list exists?
- Do you have (or can you create) cues or mechanisms to remind you the list exists?
- How will you access the list?
- If the list requires writing, how will you create a file/page/paper that can be written into?
```

Trigger list for thinking about how to create a list:

```

About the three elements:

- List:
    - Create the list
    - Update the list based on the results from Lesson
- Log:
    - Record progress and results from using the list
- Lesson:
    - Reflect on the Log and write down what you learned

About the cycle:

- Typically, you start by creating a list, then repeat Log and Lesson
    - List → Log → Lesson → Log → Lesson → ...
- You revise the list after going through Lesson
    - ... → Lesson → List → Log → ...
