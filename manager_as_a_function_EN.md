# Manager as a Function (MaaF)
- Treat the manager as a function that team members can use as needed. Abbreviated as MaaF.
- Roles:
    - Manager: The person who manages the project and/or team. One person.
    - Members: People who report to the manager. n people.
- Benefits:
    - Drives Internal DevRel. You can prioritize meeting members' needs.
    - Continuous improvement. You can keep improving it in terms of how the "function" is built and how it's presented.

# Tools
A work list to understand and try MaaF:

```markdown
- 1: When you hear "MaaF," write down what comes to mind
    - (write)
    - ...
- 2: Read the "Examples" below
- 3: Write your level of understanding of MaaF
    - (write)
    - ...
- 4: Think about whether MaaF is worth using
    - (choose y|n)
    - Reason: (write your reason)
```

A checklist for thinking about what you will provide as MaaF:

```markdown
- 1: Will you offer Direct Appointment?
- 2: Will you use AMA?
- 3: Will you use RMA?
- 4: Will you use office hours?
- 5: Will you use manager tickets?
```

A trigger list for thinking about how to provide MaaF:

```markdown
- How will you design and display modes?
- Will you roll it out to all members right away, or start by selecting specific members to try it with?
- Will you respond to member requests immediately, or ask them to tolerate some delay?
- What are the main "delivery methods" you can provide, and how many patterns are there?
```

A trigger list for thinking about how to provide AMA:

```markdown
- Synchronous or asynchronous?
- 1:1, small group, or larger?
- Do you take one question at a time and answer, or collect multiple questions and answer them in a batch?
- For the above, what is your preference?
- For the above, what is the members' preference?
```

A question list for designing manager tickets:

```markdown
- 1: For one ticket, what are the "time spent," "work content," and "output"?
- 2: Over what cadence do you issue tickets, and how many each time?
- 3: In which tool will you issue and respond to tickets?
- 4: How will you handle interruptions while working on a ticket?
- 5: How will you visualize or notify the status of ticket work (accepted, in progress, paused, etc.)?
```

# Example: "Modes" a manager presents to members
- MaaF mode
    - Operate as MaaF
- Solo mode
    - Do individual work
    - Do neither MaaF nor meetings
- Default mode
    - The normal state that is neither MaaF nor Solo
    - Since you're the manager, you have many meetings, or you hold them as needed

# Example: Interfaces a manager can offer
- Direct Appointment
    - Allow anyone to freely add time to open slots on the manager's calendar
- AMA (Ask Me Anything)
- [RMA (Request Me Anything)](rma_request_me_anything.md)
- Office hours
- Manager tickets
    - A ticket is something that "lets you ask the manager for one hour of consideration and an answer"
    - The manager issues tickets to members for them to use
    - Work via tickets is done asynchronously, and answers are provided as messages or documents. You may implement a prototype or similar, but it's not required
