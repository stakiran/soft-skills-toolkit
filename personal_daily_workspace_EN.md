# Personal Daily Workspace (PDW)
- Securing a personal, text-based workspace on a daily basis
- Daily routine:
    - 1: Create today's workspace (copy/paste from yesterday's)
    - 2: Work and take notes as needed
    - 3: At the end of the day, do a light review and some organization
- The key benefit is that it remains as text, making it easy to review later and to integrate with generative AI

# Tools
A list of things that might make PDW more effective when you write them down:

```markdown
- A task list, especially split into four buckets: today, tomorrow, this week, and later
- Waiting-for list: `(sent date) (who) (topic)`
- YWT (what I did, what I learned, what I'll do next)
- Ideas that came to mind
- Drafts of writing you can't finish in one sitting
- A positive journal
- A negative journal (recommended to delete on or after the next day, since keeping it can become stressful)
- Putting vague, unsettled thoughts or worries into words
```

A trigger list you can use to decide where to run your PDW:

```markdown
- Write to a local file? Use a cloud tool? Write locally and upload to the cloud?
- Plain text? Rich text?
- Markdown? Free-form?
- Handle images? Or text-only is enough?
- File? Page? Slide?
- Could you implement it with chat, a wiki, notes, tickets like Issues, or a whiteboard?
- One page per day? One page per week? One page per month?
- Creating the daily frame manually vs automating it?
- How will you integrate with generative AI, and what prompts will you use?
```
