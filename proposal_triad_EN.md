# Proposal Triad
- A three-element enum-style framework used when thinking through a proposal's content and wording

# Tools
A Why-What-How list to ensure the audience understands it with no blind spots

```markdown
- Q1: Tell me Why. Benefits, impact, rationale, etc.
- Q2: Tell me What. The proposal overview, the shape of it, the mental picture, etc.
- Q3: Tell me How. The concrete approach to execution.
```

A 3T checklist to confirm before communicating a proposal:

```markdown
If any of these are not Yes, your proposal will likely be dismissed outright.

- 1: Trust: There is enough trust that if you send a message, you'll get a reply.
    - y | n
- 2: Tradition: You can communicate it without deviating from the customs of the target org and its surrounding context.
    - y | n
- 3: Theory: What you propose is structured according to the logic the target expects.
    - y | n
```

A checklist to confirm when proposing an initiative:

```markdown
- 1: Needs: Necessity. You can make a proposal that makes them want it even if they have to pay for it.
    - y | n
- 2: Seeds: Feasibility. A logical hypothesis is formed using numbers and language, or there is a tangible artifact you can actually test.
    - y | n
- 3: Feeds: Sustainability. At the "Seeds" level, you have built the business model and operations such that supply can keep running sustainably.
```

A TEA line you can use to crisply communicate the target audience and the benefit:

```markdown
- Target: (Who it's for)
- Effect: (The impact on the Target; preferably with numbers)
- Action: (What you'll concretely do or how you'll frame it in order to create the Effect for the Target)
```
