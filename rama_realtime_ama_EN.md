# RAMA (Realtime AMA)
- Run AMA (Ask Me Anything) in real time
- Comparison:
    - AMA is typically handled asynchronously by collecting questions in a thread
    - RAMA is run synchronously within a conversation or meeting
        - RAMA embeds an AMA segment into the agenda
        - In contrast, [MAMA (Meeting As An AMA)](mama_meeting_as_an_ama.md) dedicates the meeting entirely to AMA
- Target audience: managers who design and facilitate meetings

# Tools
A checklist to see whether you can incorporate RAMA into your regular meetings:

```markdown
The more "Yes" answers you have, the more it's worth incorporating.

- 1: Speaking time is skewed toward a few people, and you feel the discussion/experience quality isn't great
    - y | n
- 2: There are multiple members who seem like they want to say something but hold back, or you've observed this multiple times
    - y | n
- 3: You feel a lingering frustration that you can't fully surface through 1:1s or other casual chats
    - y | n
- 4: There's no culture of thinking before speaking/discussing, so meetings tend to become reactive and ad hoc
    - y | n
```

A question list you can use when incorporating RAMA into a meeting:

```markdown
- 1: How often is the meeting held, and how long is each session?
    - (Write it down)
- 2: Is it worth having a RAMA segment in the agenda every time?
    - y | n
    - (Write the reason)
- 3: If yes, roughly what percentage of the meeting should it take?
    - 20% | 30% | 50% | 100% (same as MAMA)
- 4: Are there any themes you want to set? How many?
    - (Write it down)
- 5: If silence happens (no questions for 30+ seconds), how will you facilitate?
    - (Write it down)
- 6: How will you accept questions?
    - No special setup | Round robin (each person, n rounds) | Introduce another mechanism
    - (Describe the mechanism you will use)
