# RMA (Request Me Anything)
- An adaptation of AMA (Ask Me Anything): you continuously accept requests and process them
- Roles:
    - Counter: the person who receives and handles requests. One person
    - Requesters: people who submit requests. n people
- Formats:
    - Synchronous: hold a meeting dedicated to RMA and handle requests one by one on the spot
    - Asynchronous: accept requests in some way, then process the accumulated requests asynchronously over time

# Tools
A list of questions to decide whether you should use RMA:

```markdown
If you answered No, you probably shouldn't use RMA.

- Q1: You are in a position where you "approve" applications or requests from team members
    - y|n
- Q2: You feel there are some issues or pain points in the day-to-day operations of incoming requests
    - y|n
- Q3: Since requests are not communication, it's fine to make them more efficient and optimized
    - y|n
- Q4: You have enough IT literacy to create a request form yourself
    - y|n
```

Framework: "Five Category":

```markdown
- 1: Approval: Please approve ~~
- 2: Share: Please share ~~
- 3: Coordination: Please connect me with ~~
- 4: Escalation: Please escalate ~~
- 5: Answer: Please answer about ~~

* Treat anything that doesn't fit 1-4 as 5 ("Other")

Trigger list for choosing tools for asynchronous RMA:

```markdown
- Use chat like Slack or Teams?
- Use forms like Google Forms or Microsoft Forms?
- Use GitHub Issues?
- Create a collaboratively editable page and have people add bullet points?
```

Trigger list for designing synchronous RMA:

```markdown
- How many minutes is the meeting?
- Is the time spent per request fixed or variable?
- Will you actually process requests during the meeting, or only accept them and provide an initial response?
```
