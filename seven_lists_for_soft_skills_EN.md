# The Seven Lists Principle for Turning Soft Skills into Tools
- Background:
    - Soft skills are hard:
        - It's difficult to turn them into tangible tools in the form of hardware or software ("hard tools")
        - Pure concepts are hard to use in practice
    - Having artifacts like templates and checklists ("soft tools") helps, at least somewhat
- Seven Lists organizes the key perspectives of soft tools into seven categories

# Tools
The Seven Lists:

```markdown
- Task: List instructions or steps. Assumes people will follow what is written
- Span: List items that have a temporal length (a duration/time span)
- Trigger: List hints that can serve as inspiration
- Question: List open-ended questions
- Check: List questions that can be answered with y | n (confirmation items)
- Label: List classification categories. Assumes people will tag/categorize using these
- Fill: List blanks/fields. Assumes people will fill them in. A template
```

Visual Format:

```
               Task    Span
     Trigger                  Question
            Check        Label
                   Fill
```
