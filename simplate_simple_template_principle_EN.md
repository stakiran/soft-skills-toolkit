# Simplate Principle
- Simplate (Simple Template)
- Templates should be simple
- Specifically, they must satisfy all of the following:
    - Categories and whitespace are provided to ensure readability
    - Fits within a single page
    - Move supplemental explanations to a separate document
    - Do not write any annotations at all, including pointers to supplemental explanations

# Tools
Question list to ask which format to use:

```markdown
- Q1: Markdown?
- Q2: Rich text like Word? If not Markdown, why?
- Q3: A page-based tool like Notion or Google Docs? If not a file, why?
- Q4: Classic slides like PowerPoint? Why does it have to be slides?
- Q5: Next-gen slides like Canva or Figma? Why does it have to be a design tool?
```
