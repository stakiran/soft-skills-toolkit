# TEA Lines for Writing Summaries
- Summary format
- Lets you concisely state an overview and impact
- TEA:
    - Target: Who this is for
    - Effect: The impact on the Target (preferably quantified)
    - Action: What you will concretely do, or how you will frame it, to create the Effect for the Target
- Write each as a single line

# Tools
A TEA line template

```markdown
# TEA
- Target: (Who this is for)
- Effect: (Quantified impact on the Target)
- Action: (What you will concretely do, or how you will frame it, to achieve that)
```

A checklist to decide when to use TEA:

```markdown
If all answers are No, it's acceptable to use TEA.

- Is this a situation where it's OK to write a tl;dr? Would it be understood if you did?
    - y | n
- Is this a situation where you should write an executive summary?
    - y | n
- Do you need to create a Summary section and write about a page worth of content?
    - y | n
```

# Notes: The intent of TEA
- Target specifies the Who
- Effect specifies the Why
- Action specifies the How or What
